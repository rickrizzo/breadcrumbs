# Breadcrumbs [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rickrizzo/breadcrumbs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rickrizzo/breadcrumbs)

##What is it?
A tool for those seeking adventure, and a chance for me to practice with the MEAN stack. Breadcrumbs is the app Jack and Jill would have died for. Click to save geolocations on a hike or run. These points are then connected and stored. They can be accessed by friends and family in case of emergencies.

###In this project I plan to use the following
* GitHub
* Node.js
* Express.js
* Jade
* Angular.js
* MongoDB
* Heroku
* Travis CI
* Bootstrap 3
* Gulp
* SASS

###Goals
The end goal is to create a simple site with a RESTful API and then call that in iOS, and potentially watchOS. Learning good design practices and deployment strategies are also goals. Progress will be posted on my [blog](thoughts.robrusso.io).
