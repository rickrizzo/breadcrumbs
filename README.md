A tool for those seeking adventure, and a chance for me to practice with the MEAN stack.
###In this project I plan to use the following
* GitHub
* Node.js
* Angular.js
* Gulp
* SASS
* Heroku
* TravisCI

The end goal is to create a simple site with a RESTful API and then call that in iOS, and learn how to iOS development at the same time
I decided not to use Express so I would get a better understanding of how things work.
