# Breadcrumbs [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rickrizzo/breadcrumbs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rickrizzo/breadcrumbs)

##What is it?
A tool for those seeking adventure, and a chance for me to practice with the MEAN stack. Breadcrumbs is the app Jack and Jill would have died for. Click to save geolocations on a hike or run. These points are then connected and stored. They can be accessed by friends and family in case of emergencies.

###In this project I plan to use the following
* GitHub
* Node.js
* Angular.js
* Express
* Jade
* MongoDB
* Gulp
* SASS
* Heroku
* Travis CI
* Bootstrap 3

The end goal is to create a simple site with a RESTful API and then call that in iOS, and learn how to iOS development at the same time
